<h1>Threat Modeling</h1>

When assessing the security of the system, it is important to understand the threats you are trying to protect against. What outside attacks do you expect and need to prevent? What kind of resources do you expect outside attackers to have? How much can you trust your users, your employees, your system administrators, or other people with legitimate access? What sensitive information needs to be protected?

Having a clear <strong>threat model</strong> of the security that your system needs can help you make decisions about the countermeasures you employ. Some security features are low-cost and thus make sense to use even in low-risk environments, but others may be difficult to implement or make your software harder to use. You also want to make sure that you are directing your efforts toward the most crucial or vulnerable parts of your system first.

Another important thing to think about is the <strong>surface of attack</strong>. What are all the ways that an attacker could interact with your system? In general, you want to minimize this. Make sure that every service that can be accessed remotely is actually necessary. Minimize the number of people who have access to the physical hardware, the ability to modify the software, the permission to change the data, and so on. The fewer places you have to secure, the better.

Figuring all of this out is not easy. You may be caught off guard by a type of attack that you simply did not think of when coming up with your threat model. You might not realize the sensitivity of some of the information you had. You might underestimate the resources of your attackers or overestimate the trustworthiness of your users.

There have been <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Final-Cyberbibliography-2019.pdf">efforts to try to quantify how secure a system is but there is no accepted way to do this fully yet, as explained in the overview of this collection of research</a>: "Today, cybersecurity remains an art, rather than a science. We can qualitatively assess improvement,  but  the  truth  is  that  even  moderately  precise measures of cybersecurity remain elusive in that there is no generally agreed upon system of measurement that is &ndash; even metaphorically &ndash; equivalent to the concept of generally accepted accounting principles."
