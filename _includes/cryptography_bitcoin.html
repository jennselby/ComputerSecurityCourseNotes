<h2>Bitcoin</h2>

<p>Bitcoin makes extensive use of cryptographically secure hash functions in order to process new transactions. The computers processing new transactions try out different salts with the transaction data in order to find partial matches in the output hash (the partial match is set depending on how fast new bitcoins should be issued). The first processor to find the partial match is rewarded with new bitcoins, and the transaction data becomes part of the blockchain of verified transactions.</p>

The idea is that as long as more than half of the computers processing the transactions are being honest, then the correct transactions will go through. The <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.goodaudience.com/what-is-a-51-attack-or-double-spend-attack-aa108db63474">51% attack</a> involves getting more than half of the processors to verify the same fake transactions.</p>
