<h2>Reverse Engineering</h2>
<p><strong>Reverse engineering </strong>is just the practice of trying to figure out what some piece of code or hardware is doing.</p>
<p>If you have access to the source code, this is easier, but as you may know from reading other people's code, it is not always straightforward. Why are these things in a list in this order? What does that '5' mean? What does this website they're accessing do? Without good naming, comments, and documentation, it can be hard to be sure. If the tools used to write or work with the software no longer exist and the developers are not available or don't remember, it can be very hard to figure out how everything worked, as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/innovation/nasa-image-satellite-reverse-engineering">people working with old NASA satellites can tell you</a>.</p>
<p>And that's if the people who wrote the software weren't <em>trying</em> to make it hard to reverse engineer. If people are trying to keep you from understanding the code, either to hide nefarious things the code is doing or to try to keep their proprietary code secret, it can be much harder. Both the high-level source code and the machine code that it compiles to can be obscured. You can make variable and function names hard to read, use more uncommon functions or operations, and go about things in roundabout ways. Here are some examples:</p>

</ul>
<p>Some reverse engineering doesn't involve code that you have; sometimes it is trying to figure out what some other system is doing. Maybe you realized that software on your computer is contacting some suspicious server. You could look at what it is sending and send something slightly different to see how the server responds, to start to try to figure out what this server is doing and how it works.</p>
