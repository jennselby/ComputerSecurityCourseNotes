<h2>Null Pointer Dereferences</h2>
<p>This example comes from the book <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12746081-a-bug-hunter-s-diary?from_search=true"><em>A Bug Hunter's Diary </em>by Tobias Klein</a>[1].</p>
<p>This vulnerability is less common than the ones we've studied so far, but it provides an interesting look into how computers work and how sometimes relatively straightforward errors can become dangerous security risks.</p>
<p>As we saw in the <a class="jump-to-section" href="#buffer-overflows">Buffer Overflows</a> section, frequently computer programs are dealing with pointers or references to different areas of memory that hold the objects for that program. We generally want to get some particular field in the object, with syntax like person.name or person-&gt;name, depending on the language. If person is null (or zero or none), the deference fails, and we get an exception or crash. If that object is coming from user input, the user could deliberately cause the pointer to be null, creating a denial of service when the program or system crashes.</p>
<p>However, there is an even greater danger. A null pointer deference usually causes a crash because it is essentially asking for memory position zero, which is almost always not available to the program. However, if the malicious user was able to create memory at position zero, which is possible on some systems, they could put in their own object in this memory space, and their object would now be dereferenced by their null pointer. If that object was being used to provide addresses for future function calls, the attacker can now control what code gets executed in the future. They have gained control of the program.</p>
