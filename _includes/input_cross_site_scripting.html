<h2>Cross-site Scripting</h2>
<p><strong>Cross-site scripting</strong> (often abbreviated as <strong>XSS</strong>) becomes possible if you display user input on a web page without validating it in some way. Browsers are going to evaluate the input as code if you include it in certain ways.</p>
<p>Web browsers need to go through each element on a web page and run any HTML, CSS, and JavaScript found within. If one user's unvalidated input is being displayed to other users (for instance, in a comments section), they are now able to run JavaScript in the browser of the other users. This might give them access to private information that your site is sending to be displayed for the other user.</p>
<p>Fixing this typically involves some kind of sanitization. Most programming languages have some library calls that will escape symbols that are meaningful in HTML so that they will instead just be displayed as characters. Even better is to avoid setting the innerHTML property with user input, if it is not necessary to evaluate and render the HTML tags in the input; there are other ways to set the content that will treat the HTML tags like plain text and not as code or markup.</p>
