<h2>Dangers of Eval</h2>
<p><strong>Eval</strong> is the process of taking a string of text and evaluating it as code. Some programming languages have a function named eval that will take a string and evaluate it as code. For instance, in some languages something like</p>
<pre>eval("5 + 2")</pre>
<p>would evaluate to 7 (the numerical value; not a string).</p>
<p>We need to be very careful when we are about to interpret a string as code, whether it is a database, browser, interpreter, or anything else doing the interpreting. We cannot just put user input into an interpreter without sanitizing or validating it first. If possible we want to avoid interpreting it at all by avoiding the use of eval altogether. See <a target="_blank" target="_blank" href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201206/eval_really_is_dangerous.html">Eval Really Is Dangerous</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#Never_use_eval!">Never use eval()!</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nczonline.net/blog/2013/06/25/eval-isnt-evil-just-misunderstood/">Eval Isn't Evil, Just Misunderstood</a> for some more explanation of what can happen as well as some examples of when eval is used unnecessarily.</p>
<p>It is not always obvious when strings will be evaluated; avoiding the command named eval is not always enough. We always want to be very careful about what we are doing with user input, making sure that it is never interpreted unless we are completely sure that is necessary and we have validated the input as much as possible. Some examples of a hidden eval are using the innerHTML property to set the content of an HTML element or using the input() function in Python 2 (this has been fixed in Python 3).</p>
